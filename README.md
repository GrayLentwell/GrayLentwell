earlier in the song i used the term "galvanistic," and galvanism is the concept, uh, the obsolete scientific theory that there is a kind of electricity flowing through our bloodstreams, and that was our life force. i used the term because i came across it in, uh, mary shelley's, uh, "frankenstein", and that book is sort of an exploration of the theme of creating a character, of making up a person. so i used the term "galvanistic" to allude to that book as a sort of a symbol of how i, like, created you as a character. i'm pretending that i know a lot more about you than i actually do, and also to refer to the fact that i've fallâ€”fallen in love with the characters you've created in, uh, your body of work

this is the part of the song where i start to regret writing it
